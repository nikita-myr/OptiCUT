# OptiCUT v-0.1

This program is designed to simplify the work of engineers in the field of designing aluminum windows, calculating the necessary materials for specific products, as well as optimizing cutting.

The principle of operation: 
- You enter the name of the whip (position), its color, length, width of the saw cut and the minimum allowable remainder.
- On the "Settings" tab, specify the name of the output file, whether you need pdf and the path to the folder where your future file will be saved. 
- The program processes the data you entered and gives you a table in Excel format and if you specified, then a pdf file with the result according to the saving path you specified earlier.


At the moment, the basic interface of interaction and the function of cutting parts from a whip are implemented. In the near future, additional functionality will be added for cutting the profile of the sashes, calculating the number and size of glass in the sashes.
